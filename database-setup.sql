-- WhatsApp Business Portal - Database Setup Script
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor

-- 1. Create ConversationMemory table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ConversationMemory (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  recipient TEXT NOT NULL,
  sender TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- 2. Create n8n_chat_histories table (optional, for advanced features)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS n8n_chat_histories (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  session_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  message JSONB NOT NULL
);

-- 3. Enable Row Level Security (recommended for production)
ALTER TABLE ConversationMemory ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE n8n_chat_histories ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 4. Create policies for read access
-- Note: Adjust these policies based on your security requirements
CREATE POLICY "Enable read access for all users" ON ConversationMemory
FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Enable read access for all users" ON n8n_chat_histories
FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- 5. Insert sample data for testing
INSERT INTO ConversationMemory (message, recipient, sender) VALUES

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_conversation_memory_recipient ON ConversationMemory(recipient);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_conversation_memory_created_at ON ConversationMemory(created_at);

-- 7. Verify the setup
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_messages FROM ConversationMemory;
SELECT DISTINCT sender as unique_senders FROM ConversationMemory WHERE sender != 'business_number';
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sender) as unique_customers FROM ConversationMemory WHERE sender != 'business_number';

-- Success message
SELECT 'Database setup completed successfully! ðŸŽ‰' as status;
